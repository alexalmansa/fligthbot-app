# fligthbot-app

This is an app designed to work with the GoFly server that can be found here: https://github.com/marcllort/GoFly 

The app connects to the server and offers a graphic interface to communicate with it. 
Apart from just communicating, the app interprets things like adresses and offers google maps links, phone links and web links.

Remember, if you are using your android studio emulator to run the app in the same computer where you are running the server, the ip you should use is 10.0.2.2.
