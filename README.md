# fligthbot-app

This is an app designed to work with the GoFly server that can be found here: https://github.com/marcllort/GoFly 

The app connects to the server and offers a graphic interface to communicate with it. 
Apart from just communicating, the app interprets things like adresses and offers google maps links, phone links and web links.
